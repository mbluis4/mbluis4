- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luis E. MillÃ¡n. I'm a mechannical Engineer currently transitioning to web development. Since I took a subject in College named "Computation for engineers", I felt in love with programming. Back then, I learned Visual Basic and the way the code unraveled before me was inspiring. Fast-forward some good years in the Hydraulics and Quality assurance department and finally I'm determined to make it into this awesome Web and Software development world.

- ðŸŒ± I will be uploading every major project I built in this journey. 

- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me by email: mbluis@gmail.com
